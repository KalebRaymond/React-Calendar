* Storing & loading events via JSON
	> Store events in a json file
	> Call api via redux actions to perform CRUD operations on json
	> Fetch & render events on month change

	> Keep all events in memory at time or virtualize based on current view?

* Use ChatGPT somehow?

* MSW

* Rendering the events
	> Get the dates that are visible on the calendar
		- Need to rewrite the backend so that events are saved per day
	> Get the events that fall on those dates
		- axios get params
		- If A > Y or B < X then the lines AB and XY don't intersect -> take inverse of this to find events that do have dates that fall in current view
		- NO -> Fetch all events and filter them on client side ❤️
		- Complex query params using not operator
		- Middleware?
		- Need to figure out how to store dates -> Need month year and date info
	> Render the events on the screen in the appropriate place*
		- This is going to be the most difficult probably lol
		- EventBuilder returns single/multi/split (goes into prev/next month) events depending on date range of event
