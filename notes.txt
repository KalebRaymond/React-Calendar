* Storing & loading events via JSON
	> Store events in a json file
	> Call api via redux actions to perform CRUD operations on json
	> Fetch & render events on month change

	> Keep all events in memory at time or virtualize based on current view?

* Rendering the events
	> Get the dates that are visible on the calendar
		- Need to rewrite the logic that draws the CalendarGridCards
		- Have an API just for getting calendar dates
		- Return an array of objects where each object is a visible date, object contains day, month, year so that they can be passed down to other components ex. the CreateEventModal
	> Get the events that fall on those dates
		- axios get params
	> Render the events on the screen in the appropriate place*
		- This is going to be the most difficult probably lol
		- EventBuilder returns single/multi/split (goes into prev/next month) events depending on date range of event
